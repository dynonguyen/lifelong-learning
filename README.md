## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lifelong-learning.git
   cd lifelong-learning
   ```

2. Choose a language folder (e.g., `python/`, `go/`, `rust/`, `typescript/`)

3. Start with [001-installation.md](./python/001-installation.md) to set up your environment

4. Follow the topics in order or jump to specific concepts you want to learn
